    <p>Symetrical All-Wheel-Drive</p>

<h1>Subaru Impreza GP7 - drivetrain</h1>
<h3> Driveline upgrades aka "Power Delivery"</h3>
<p>The Subaru is an All-Wheel-Drive vehicle. It is said that between 17-25% of total power can be lost
  between the engine - transmission - driveline and wheels, there is addtional tax of ~2% for automatic
  transmissions, like the CVT in this
  car. For reference FWD and RWD cars have drivetrain losses between 10-15% and 10-18% respectively.</p>
<p>
  Unlike most tuner cars, the aftermarket engine-power options for the FB20 are limited. With that in mind we,
  the tuner can turn
  focus towards improving driveline efficiencies.</p>
<p> There are a number of places where Subaru uses soft
  bushings to provide a comfortable ride. However by replacing these bushings with harder materials we can
  improve power transfer, thus reducing AWD drivetrain losses. As with all bushing upgrades, NVH will increase.

<p>If I were to postulate, each of these bushing would translate to a 0.5%-2% driveline efficiency. Added
  together, they definitely increase torque driven to wheels. </p>
