  <h1>Subaru Impreza Tuner</h1>
  <h2>Drivetrain</h2>
  <img src="images/driveline.jpg" />
  <p>Subaru names it's drivetrain as Symmetrical All-Wheel-Drive. The drive axles are of similar length left-right
    which allows power distribution to be balanced. This is one of Subaru's best features providing an extra degree of
    driving agility felt especially through corners. </p>

  <h3> Driveline upgrades aka "Power Delivery"</h3>
  <p>The Subaru is an All-Wheel-Drive vehicle. It is said that between 17-25% of total power can be lost
    between the engine - transmission - driveline and wheels, there is additional tax of ~2% for automatic
    transmissions, like the CVT in this
    car. For reference FWD and RWD cars have drivetrain losses between 10-15% and 10-18% respectively.</p>
  <p>
    Unlike most tuner cars, the aftermarket engine-power options for the FB20 are limited. With that in mind we,
    the tuner can turn
    focus towards improving driveline efficiencies.</p>
  <p> There are a number of places where Subaru uses soft
    bushings to provide a comfortable ride. However by replacing these bushings with harder materials we can
    improve power transfer, thus reducing AWD drivetrain losses. As with all bushing upgrades, NVH will increase.

  <h3>Pulleys and Harmonic Dampener</h3>
  <figure>
    <img class="ntb" src="images/Fluid_Damper.jpg" />
    <figcaption>Fluidampr - a harmonic damper</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Many people tend to replace their pulleys with lightweight versions. The theory behind it, is to reduce the
    rotating mass allowing for the engine to spin up faster giving more engine response. I like the idea behind
    replacing all the pulleys with lighter ones, all except the crank pulley. </p>
  <p>The OEM crank pulley uses a rubber damper which reduces engine vibration, by removing this dampening, it can cause
    ill-effects for bearings and valvetrain. The crank pulley instead can be replaced with an aftermarket harmonic
    dampener. One like Fluidamper or ATI Super damper. The effect would be a wider RPM range of dampening. This, in
    theory, will provide smoother acceleration, and less vibration allowing for regained power usually lost to
    destructive vibrations. It has been quoted 1-2% gains with an aftermarket harmonic dampener as well, better engine
    longevity.</p>

  <h3>Engine Mounts</h3>

    <figcaption>Engine Mounts</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>A major place where power delivery can be increased is replacing the OEM rubber engine mounts. These aftermarket
    parts are usually made from a combination of aluminum and polyurethane bushings, these can significantly reduce
    engine movement in the engine bay thus giving a increased amount of torque delivered to the rest of the driveline. I
    myself have not installed these in my car, so I cannot speak to their ease of installation. I am noting them here
    because of their use various forms of racing.
  </p>


  <h3>Pitch Stop</h3>
  <figure>
    <img class="ntb" src="images/pitchstop.jpg" />
    <figcaption>Pitch Stop - aka dogbone</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>A simple modification is to replace the soft and squishy OEM pitchstop with an aftermarket part. These parts
    usually come with polyurethane bushings which are stiffer than the OEM rubber. The reduces the amount of engine
    "bucking" which translates to lost power delivery. There is also the option to use solid aluminum, however this
    isn't recommended since it will increase NVH significantly through the firewall. Many manufacturers including Subaru
    (Group N) make these parts, take your pick.</p>

  <h3>Transmission Mount</h3>
  <figure>
    <img class="ntb" src="images/ckessp.jpg" />
    <figcaption>Transmission Mount insert - CKE SSP</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The Subaru transmission mount (CVT or Manual) is a rubber unit which is somewhat hollow. This allows for vibration
    to be soaked up during normal operation. However like the pitch stop, the OEM transmission mount is soft. It
    deflects quite significantly under heavy loads causing lost energy transmitted to the rear wheels. You can install a
    transmission insert, made of polyurethane, or replace the transmission mount with a aftermarket one. </p>
  <p>Additionally with the CVT, there is a torque converter in the mix. At certain speeds, at or around 20 mph, some may
    find a certain wobble feeling happens due to the torque converter not being completely locked up. An aftermarket
    insert or transmission mount can reduce or remove this wobble/jarring feeling caused by the torque converter and
    mushy OEM transmission mount. In either case, power delivery will be much better.</p>

  <h3>Drive shaft carrier bushing</h3>
  <figure>
    <img class="ntb" src="images/driveshaft-carrier-bushing.jpg" />
    <figcaption>Pitch Stop - aka dogbone</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Moving further back in the driveline, another place where rubber is used is the driveshaft carrier bushing. Though
    this isn't completely necessary, it is worth noting that some driveshaft play can be reduced by replacing the OEM
    bushings with solid aluminum pieces. It has been mentioned that the OEM bushings are very difficult to remove unless
    they are completely worn. Also the bracket that supports the driveshaft also has a very flexible bushing/bearing to
    reduce driveshaft vibrations. This bushing replacement should be low on the list of upgrades.</p>

  <h3>Differential mounts and lock-downs</h3>
  <figure>
    <img class="ntb" src="images/differentiallockdown.jpg" />
    <figcaption>differential lock-down</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>At the very end of the driveline, are the differential brace and bushings. The OEM bushes are made of rubber and
    have significant flex under load. Here is a place where the tuner can regain a noticeable amount of power. By
    replacing the rubber bushings in the brace with polyurethane and solid bushings in the mount one can realize a
    significant amount of torque being delivered to the rear wheels. This is highly recommended, but can be a more
    involved modification.
  </p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Each of these bushing would translate to a 0.5%-2% driveline efficiency. Added together, they definitely increase
    torque driven to wheels, coupled with suspension modification it is a clear place where the tuner can take
    advantage
    and make more power through driveline efficiencies.
