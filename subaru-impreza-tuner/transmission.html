    <h3>The TR580 Transmission </h3>

    <p>The TR580 is a Subaru "Lineartronic" CVT. The number 580 relates to its length in millimeters.
      The transmission uses a metal chain and pulley system to vary the drive ratios. This transmission is categorized
      as an automatic and so, coupled with a torque converter. There is the option to utilize a 6 speed manual shift
      mode via/ steering wheel paddle shifters.
    </p>
    <p>The CVT utilizes "Active Torque Split" which is an electronically controlled multi-plate transfer clutch that
      dynamically distributes power between front and rear axles. Anywhere from 60% F / 40% R for crusing
      or 50% F / 50% R on-demand. This allows the tranmission efficiency and better gas mileage.
      For comparison, the manual transmission center differential is always a mechanical 50% 50% F/R split. </p>
    </ul>

    <b>Maintenance</b>
    <p>For the most part the tranmission is reliable. It is often stated that the transmission fluid should be
      checked/replaced every 30k miles. This can help keep the fluid coupling of the pulley system and valving in good
      working order. In my expereince, I had the dealer replace the CVT fluid at 30k. The difference was a smoother,
      quieter and tighter power deliver. I suspect the original fluid had debris from transmission break-in.
    </p>
    <b>Reliability</b>
    <p><img class="oem-cvt-cooler" src="images/cvt-cooler-oem.jpg" />Heat is the number one enemy of this transmision.
      The OEM CVT heater/cooler "can" (right) is tied to the coolant
      system via an water/oil heat exchange. In some cases, during prolonged periods of high load, the heat exchanger
      system is insufficient. The CVT fluid becomes too hot and trips an electronic "limp mode" which limits engine
      RPMs to below 4000 and only allows the CVT to run in less taxing gear ratios. For this reason it is recommended
      that a CVT cooler (below) be installed. An inline method (utilizes oem cooler) or the bypass method can be used
      depending on climate zone you live in. I use a Derale 19 row staked plate cooler, but really any transmission
      cooler would work.</p>

    <b>Performance </b>
    <p>Another way to extract the most fun out of the transmission is to utilize the 6 speed manual mode via paddle
      shifters. By using manual mode, it is possible to shift the transmission like a sequential gearbox. Manual mode
      also allows the driver to rev up to ~6000rpms before the transmission automatically shifts into the next gear
      ratio.

      While using manual mode it is also possible to hold RPMs for engine braking or for cornering holeshot. The CVT
      has an automatic safety check which does not let the engine over rev. This is paticually useful for
      novice/advanced drivers as there is no possibility of grenading the engine from going past red
      line. The singal for NO-SHIFT is denoted as a beep that comes from the dashboard when the driver has requestd
      a ratio shift (downshift), but the engine is already above 4000rpm.</p>

    <p>Above is a rather strange looking dyno graph derived from real data. A gear ratio change using the
      variable ratio pullies, can produce an interesting torque surge to the AWD system.</p>
