  <p>The <i>TR580</i> is Subaru's "Lineartronic" CVT - Continuously Variable Transmission. It is the little brother to
    the
    high-torque TR690 CVT.</p>



  <p>The transmissions both use a metal chain and pulley system to vary the drive ratios. There is no gearbox like in a
    traditional automatic transmission. The TR580 is a newer updated design developed for "reasonable" torque
    application.
    It is often mated with FB20 and FB25 series Subaru engines. </p>

  <h3>TR580 models FB20 FB25</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Impreza NA 1.6/2.0</li>
    <li>Crosstrek NA 2.0/2.5</li>
    <li>Forester NA 2.5</li>
    <li>Outback NA 2.5</li>
  </ul>



  <h3>TR6690 models FA20DiT EZ36</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>WRX 2.0T</li>
    <li>Forester 2.0T</li>
    <li>Levorg 1.8T/2.0T</li>
    <li>Legacy NA 3.6</li>
    <li>Outback NA 3.6</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The number 580 relates to the length of this case in millimeters. Subarus' . This
    transmission is categorized as an automatic and so, coupled with a torque converter.</p>

  <h3>TR690 misnomers</h3>

    <h4>WRX transmission ‚â† Impreza transmission</h4>
  TR580 sometimes gets confused amongst Subaru owners with its older brother <i>TR690</i>, Subaru's high torque CVT.
    Ironically, The TR690 is notoriously known for chain slip in high torque and modified applications. This bad
    reputation of the older sibling often casts a shadow on the TR580. While the two transmissions use a similar design,
    the TR580 has some corrections learned from its older brother. The TR580 is quite robust when paired with the
    FB20/25
    engines.</p>


  <p>
    <h3>Power split: CVT vs Manual</h3>
    TR580 CVT utilizes "Active Torque Split" which is an electronically controlled multi-plate transfer clutch that
    dynamically distributes power between front and rear axles. Anywhere from 60% F / 40% R for cruising
    or 50% F / 50% R on-demand. For comparison, the manual transmission center differential is always a mechanical 50%
    50%
    F/R split. </p>

  <p>
    In most cases (non-base models) there is the option to utilize a 6 speed manual shift mode via/ steering wheel
    paddle
    shifters. This is your best bet to getting the most out of the engine.
  </p>



  <b>Maintenance</b>
  <p>Transmission fluid should be checked/replaced every 30k miles. This can help keep the fluid coupling of the pulley
    system and valving in good working order. Subaru recommends its own CVT fluid for the TR580 and should not be
    confused
    with High-Torque Fluid (orange-red in colour). In my experience, the CVT has performed well in normal driving
    situations. I had the dealer flush and fill the CVT fluid at 30k.The difference was a smoother, quieter and tighter
    power deliver. I suspect the original fluid had debris from transmission break-in. I plan on doing another flush at
    60k. Performing this maintenance will will help the transmissions longevity.
  </p>
  <b>Reliability</b>
  <p><img class="oem-cvt-cooler" src="images/cvt-cooler-oem.jpg" />Heat is the number one enemy of all transmissions.
    The
    TR580 is prone to overheating when tasked with holding higher RPMs and heavier work loads for a prolonged period of
    time. </p>
  <p>
    The OEM CVT makes use of a heater/cooler device (pictured) shaped like a can. It is tied to the coolant
    system via an water/oil heat exchange. In some cases, during prolonged periods of high load, the heat exchanger
    system can easily become overloaded. The CVT fluid becomes too hot and trips an electronic "limp mode"
    which limits engine RPMs to below 4000 and only allows the CVT to run in less taxing gear ratios.</p>

  <p>For this reason it
    is recommended that a CVT cooler (below) be installed anticipating high engine load driving be it mountain passes or
    spirited canyon driving or hauling. An inline method (utilizes oem cooler) or the bypass method can be used
    depending
    on climate zone you live in.</p>
  <p>I use a Derale 19 row staked plate cooler, but really any transmission cooler would work. Changing
    fluid at 30-60k intervals and keeping the transmission cool will help prolong the life of the CVT. </p>

  <p>A common issue with the CVT is solenoid failure and has been reported anywhere between 80-300k miles so your
    mileage
    may vary. From my understanding this problem arises due to extended CVT use without fluid maintenance. Otherwise the
    transmission should prove stout enough for the every day commoner. </p>

    <h3>Performance </h3>
    CVT? Performance? Do those words belong in the same sentence? You decide.

  <p>The Subaru TR580 CVT has some distinct design elements that can be exploited for spirited driving.</p>

  <h3>CVT Advantages for Motorsports</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Manual Mode</b> - By shifting into manual mode, you are invited to Subaru's "smooth"
      electronic sequential 6 gear
      transmission.</li>
    <li><b>Paddle Shifters</b> - Paddle shifters allow the driver to maintain hands on wheel while
      allowing for direct shifting commands.</li>
    <li><b>RPM Control</b> - Now that you're in manual mode using paddle shifters, you can play out the various
      harmonics of the FB20 engine. From 700RPM idle all the way to an <b>unlocked</b> 6232RPMs without
      worrying about destroying
      your engine. Part of the joy of the CVT is the low barrier to entry to finding the motors optimal power band.
      You know you've found it when the engine and cvt sing ‚ô™
      Getting to know the engine throught the CVT is a safe and fun way to exploit the endlessly comically Naturally
      Aspirated FB20 engine üòç. It provides smiles all around.</b></li>
    <li><b>Engine Braking</b> - the variable ratio chain and pulley system in conjunction with stepped gear ratios can
      provide a very effective ability to control braking. One that feels natural and
      plays well the former, RPM Control </li>
    <li><b>Left foot braking</b> - This may be outside the realm of the CVT but when a third (clutch) pedal isn't
      needed,
      braking response with the left foot can greatly be increased. Practice when you can ü¶∂üèΩ</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The CVT enables a novice to push engine limits more. The CVT has wonderfully natural feeling engine braking curve
    which can be exploited for almost instant power delivery (more in graph below)
  </p>
  <h4>Rev protection</h4>
  <p>
    The CVT has an automatic safety check which does not let the engine over rev. This is particularly useful for
    novice/advanced drivers as there is no possibility going past red
    line. An example of this safety feature is an auditory beep denoting NO-SHIFT when the driver has requested
    a ratio shift (downshift with paddles), but the engine is already above 4000rpm. This will help avoid engine failure
    in the event of a miss-shift.</p>

  <p>
    The CVT has many advantages and safety features that allow novice through advanced drivers to get the most
    out of the engine and the drivetrain. The electronic active torque split technology straddles economy with
    drivetrain
    engagement.

  <h3>CVT Torque Down</h3>
  <p>Above is a rather strange looking graph. I call it a CVT dynograph and it is derived from real data. A gear ratio
    change can provide a huge surge in torque and hp using the variable ratio pulleys. It can produce an interesting
    looking graph that swings backwards in RPMs. This bump in power to the AWD system is what some people may refer to
    as CVT Surge. The driver can exploit this feature by maintaining high revolutions before a known acceleration event,
    for example holeshot and corner exit.</p>
