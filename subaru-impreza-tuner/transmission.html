<h1>The TR580 CVT Transmission </h1>

<h2>CVT</h2>
<p>The TR580 is a Subaru "Lineartronic" CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). It is also sometimes confused with its
  older brother, the TR690, Subaru's high torque CVT which can be found in larger and more powerful Legacy's + Outback's
  NA 3.6 H6 and Turbo
  2L WRX's, and 2.0L Levorg Wagons.
  The number 580 relates to the length of this case in millimeters. The two transmissions use a similar design.
  The transmission uses a metal chain and pulley system to vary the drive ratios. The TR690 is notoriously known for
  chain slip in high torque and modified applications. The TR580 on the other hand seems perfectly mated to the
  less-torquey Naturally Aspirated FB20/FB25 engines found in Subarus' Impreza, Crosstrek, Forester, and Outback. This
  transmission is categorized as an automatic and so, coupled with a torque converter. In most cases (non-base models)
  there is the option to utilize a 6 speed manual shift mode via/ steering wheel paddle shifters.
</p>
<p>The CVT utilizes "Active Torque Split" which is an electronically controlled multi-plate transfer clutch that
  dynamically distributes power between front and rear axles. Anywhere from 60% F / 40% R for crusing
  or 50% F / 50% R on-demand. This allows for tranmission efficiency through better gas mileage.
  For comparison, the manual transmission center differential is always a mechanical 50% 50% F/R split. </p>
</ul>

<b>Maintenance</b>
<p>For the most part the tranmission is reliable. It is often stated that the transmission fluid should be
  checked/replaced every 30k miles. This can help keep the fluid coupling of the pulley system and valving in good
  working order. Subaru recommends its own CVT fluid for the TR580 and should not be confused with High-Torque Fluid
  (orange-red in colour). In my expereince, I had the dealer flush and fill the CVT fluid at 30k. The difference was a
  smoother, quieter and tighter power deliver. I suspect the original fluid had debris from transmission break-in.
</p>
<b>Reliability</b>
<p><img class="oem-cvt-cooler" src="images/cvt-cooler-oem.jpg" />Heat is the number one enemy of this transmision.
  The OEM CVT heater/cooler "can" (right) is tied to the coolant
  system via an water/oil heat exchange. In some cases, during prolonged periods of high load, the heat exchanger
  system is insufficient and can be easily overloaded. The CVT fluid becomes too hot and trips an electronic "limp mode"
  which limits engine RPMs to below 4000 and only allows the CVT to run in less taxing gear ratios. For this reason it
  is recommended that a CVT cooler (below) be installed anticipating high engine load driving be it mountain passes or
  spirited canyon driving. An inline method (utilizes oem cooler) or the bypass method can be used depending on climate
  zone you live in. I use a Derale 19 row staked plate cooler, but really any transmission cooler would work. Changing
  fluid at 30-60k intervals and keeping the tranmission cool will help prolong the life of the CVT. A common issue is
  CVT solinoid failure and has been reported anywhere between 80-300k miles so your mileage may vary. Otherwise the
  transmission should prove stout enough for the every day commoner.</p>

<b>Performance </b>
<p>CVT? Performance? Do those words belong in the same sentance? You decide.

<p>The Subaru TR580 CVT has some distinct design elements that can be exploited for spirited driving.</p>

<h3>CVT Advantages for Motorsports</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Manual Mode</b> - While not a true manual, by shifitng into manual mode, you are invited to Subaru's "smooth"
    electronic sequential 6 gear
    transmission.</li>
  <li><b>Paddle Shifters</b> - Paddle shifters allow the driver to maintain hands on wheel while
    allowing for direct shifting commands.</li>
  <li><b>RPM Control</b> - Now that you're in manual mode using paddle shifters, you can play out the engine's various
    harmonics by wringing out the FB20 engine. From 700RPM idle all the way to an <b>unlocked</b> 6232RPMs without
    worrying about destorying
    your engine. Part of the joy of this car and its CVT is the low barrier to entry to finding the motors happy places.
    You know you've found it when the engine and cvt sing ‚ô™
    Getting to know the engine throught the CVT is a safe and fun way to exploit the endlessly commical Natually
    Aspirated
    FB20 engine üòç. It provides smiles all around.</b></li>
  <li><b>Engine Braking</b> - the variable ratio chain and pulley system in conjunction with stepped gear ratios can
    provide a very effective ability to control braking. One that feels natural and
    plays well the former, RPM Control </li>
  <li><b>Left foot braking</b> - This may be outside the realm of the CVT but when a third pedal isn't needed,
    braking response with the left foot can greatly be increased. Practice when you can ü¶∂üèΩ</li>
</ul>
<p>The CVT enables a novice to push engine limits more. The CVT has wonderfully natual feeling engine braking curve
  which can be exploited for almost instant power delivery (more in graph below)


<p>
  The CVT
  has an automatic safety check which does not let the engine over rev. This is paticually useful for
  novice/advanced drivers as there is no possibility going past red
  line. An example of this safety feature is an auditory beep denoting NO-SHIFT when the driver has requested
  a ratio shift (downshift with paddles), but the engine is already above 4000rpm. This will help avoid engine failure
  in the event of a miss-shift.</p>

<p>
  The CVT has many advantages and saftey feautres that allow novice through advanced drivers to get the most
  out of the engine and the drivetrain.

<h3>CVT Torque Down</h3>
<p>Above is a rather strange looking graph. I call it a CVT dynograph and it is derived from real data. A gear ratio
  change can provide a huge surge in torque and hp using the variable ratio pullies. It can produce an interesting
  looking graph that swings backwawards in RPMs. This bump in power to the AWD system is what some people may refer to
  as CVT Surge.</p>
