    <h2>Cooling - The FB20 and beyond</h2>
    <p>
        In the world of Automotive Egnineering, cooling and temperature managment are a prime concern. Taking a motor
        and its componenets to the limit will generate heat, a lot of heat. We need to utilize known concpets to reduce
        and manage overheating the:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>engine</li>
        <li>transmission</li>
        <li>exhaust</li>
        <li>electronics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For everyday driving a Subaru with an FB engine and CVT/Manual, overheating is not a major concern. The concepts
        in this document aim to better prepare the would be high-reving enthusiast for a more reliable experience.

    </p>

    <b>LIMP MODE</b>
    <p>Ever Heard of it? If you haven't experienced it, then you're lucky. You're also not pushing the engine to its
        fullest extent. That being said, you don't neccesaraly need to over tax the engine and cooling system to have
        fun. Enjoy with the notion that when you run the car hard, it will get hot.
    </p>
    <p>Primary factors for entering limp mode, are over use, abuse, or simply prolognned high revs without sufficient
        cooling. The Limp mode can be "felt" as a reduction in power delivered by the enigne. Another tell tale sign is
        the engine will be limited to a maximum of ~4000RPM. FB20/FB25</p>

    <p>
        In any case, reducing the heat in the engine bay, and its various sensors will help keep the vehicle at maximum
        engine
        performance.

    <h3>Oil</h3>
    <p>Most engines rely on their oil to keep the engine cool and lubricated. The FB Series Subaru engines are no
        different. If you run the car in hotter climates, like summer weather, using a thicker oil will help protect
        the engine components. A 0w-20 is typically recomeneded by Subaru for North American and some European
        countries. However the use of 5w-30, and even 5w-40 is permissiable. Using 5w-30 increases the upper temperature
        by 10C. This is perfect for a motor which will see higher temperatures due to full load use. </p>

    <h3>Tranmission Fluid - CVT</h3>
    <p>
        They say a poormans solution to power is gearing; but with gearing comes great responsibilty. Excessive heat
        coming from a high reving transmission can be the quickest ticket to end of happy days. The CVT fluid in the
        TR580 is highly picky about its operating temperatures. Too cold, and the car feels lurchy and inconsistent when
        accelerating or engine braking. Too hot, and you endanger the mechanical parts from exceeding there design
        parameters, in worst case, slipping a chain and friction scoring the varators. However, the TR580 CVT is rather
        dummy-proof. It knows what temperature is too much. Like oil, if you run the CVT fluid too hot, the vehicle will
        enter limp mode.
    </p>
    <p>Ways to keep the transmission fluid and casing cool. In a previous transmission chapter, we covered the use of <a
            href="transmission.html#reliability">transmission coolers</a>. While not completely neccesary, they do
        help prolong high load and high reving engine activities.
