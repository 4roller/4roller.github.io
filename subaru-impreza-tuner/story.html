<h1>Subaru Impreza Tuner - The Story</h1>

<p>This is the first car I've ever purchased. I bought it because I needed a car to commute to work and do things around
  town. </p>

<h3>📘 Origin Story</h3>
<p>Assmebled in Gunma Japan, this pacticular 2016 Subaru Impreza came with a factory installed <span
    class="cherry">STI</span></STI> roof spoiler. It kind of a hard to get option.
  Out of all the Imprezas being built for the final production year (2012-2016)
  only a handful would be choosen to have a factory installed STI tuning part!

<aside>
  When I was a teenager, I worked a summer job assembiling delivery trucks 🚐.
  Each truck was based on a work order. Some work orders would have
  extra parts that set them apart from the dozens of regular builds. For some reason, because these
  trucks were spec'd higher, I would put more heart into building the truck.
  I believe my Impreza was one such vehicle. ♥️Spirt⚡️!</aside>


<h3>Function over everything </h3>
<p>In all honesty, I didn't know what kind of car I was buying, only that it fit my initial buying criteria.
  Hatchback with good trunk space (I actually wanted a wagon), and good on gas.
  For the better part of a year I drove it stock.

<h3>Utility</h3>
<p>
  Commuter, errands, family duties, the Subaru handles it all. There were gripes about 'weak engine'
  expressed here and there, but for the most part it was a workhorse. A great untility vehicle for a single-child family. </p>

    <h3>Enter Tuner</h3>
    <p>After dropping off the kids and the wife into a more family suited vehicle, the shackles were removed.
      No longer does smooth, quiet and comfortable need to be adjectives that describe this car. Rice, I mean Race car
      would be the new charade.</p>

    <aside>Being a newb. The quest for perfomance has to start out being inexpensive, what is the best bang for the
      buck.
      The goal of the build is extract the soul of the car through mechencalical modification, a frankenstine for
      betterment of passager car
      performance.
