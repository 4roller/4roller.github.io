  <h2>Crank Case Ventilation</h2>

  <h2>Reliability and Performance</h2>
  <p></p>TLDR: I added a catch can to my breather valve. Benefits include cleaner intake for better reliability and
  performance. </p>


  <h3>Intro:</h3>
  <p>
    Modern combustion engines like the FB20 have two ventilation ports. One is the PCV, the other is the crank case
    breather valve. Most people are aware of the benefits of using a catch can (CC) or an air oil separator (AOS) for
    the positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system. </p>

  <h3>PCV:</h3>
  <p>
    You can install a CC or AOS to keep your intake cleaner. The filtered air reduces blow by oil vapors entering the
    intake manifold. For reliability, those with direct injection will benefit more than those with port injection in
    terms of carbon build up. For performance, the cleaner and cooler air entering the intake manifold via PCV will
    produce a cleaner burn. Thus producing more powa' baby. This is where most people stop.
  </p>

  <h3>Breather valve:</h3>
  <p>
    Your engine breather valve is located on the driver side of the car (USDM), under the intake manifold attached to
    the block. It's function is exactly what it sounds like, a port to help your engine breathe. The air from the
    breather valve moves in two directions depending on engine load. </p>

  </figure>
  <p>
  <p>During idle and cruising (green lines) the engine
    block creates a vacuum pulling in air from a bung under the intake (stock or aftermarket).</p>

    <img class="ntb" src="images/ccv-2.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Direction of air during idle/cruising - closed loop</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p> During high engine loads
    (red lines) the flow reverses and actually starts blowing air (and oil vapors from blow-by) out of the block back
    into the intake just before the throttle body.</p>

  <h3>Modification:</h3>
  <p>
    I've added a CC to this breather system because I am now running an aftermarket Cold Air Intake. The OEM intake
    tubing has a built in reservoir/baffle box which helps pool excess air/vapor and returns it to the block during
    suction (idle, cruising). </p>
  <figure>
    <img class="ntb" src="images/oem-intake-baffle.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>OEM intake has a baffle/catch can which pools oil vapors</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>However in practice (100% engine loads and prolonged spirited driving) even that baffle box pours a
    bunch of oil vapor into the throttle body, and into the intake manifold.</p>
  <p>The result can be a gummy throttle body
    (weird idle and unresponsive throttle) and also engine codes saying the engine is running too rich.
    The goal of this catch can on the breather side, is to keep reliability for WOT type driving.</p>
  <p>Also as a side
    performance benefit, like the AOS on the PCV side, keeping the intake cleaner, (before the throttle body) reducing
    oil vapors going into the intake manifold before combustion.</p>



  <h3>Update 2024-12</h3>
  <p>
    Since the writing of the original article, I've rerouted the Catch Can. All the information above still holds true.
    However I would like to emphasize the importance of 2 key considerations when installing your own catch can on the
    CCV.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The catch can should be free flowing. Any restricitons inside the catch can (from tiny filter elements) can
      cause the heavy flow from the CCV (during engine braking) to be impeded, causing fitting and lines to "pop off" or
      leak.</li>
    <li>The CCV return line should be routed as direct and as short as possible. Retaining the OEM line size is
      recommended. This ensures good flow and proper return presure to the intkae pipe. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>With these two things considered, you will have a clean, free flowing CCV return line that is filtered with a Catch
    Can.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
  <p>
    With both PCV and breather sides "filtering" oil vapors, there is the potential to produce a more efficient
    combustion, thus more performance at high engine loads and high RPMs.
