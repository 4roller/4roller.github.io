<h1>Subaru FB20B Engine - BOXER</h1>
<img class="letsbox" src="images/letsbox.jpeg" />
<p>The FB20B was designed as an economy engine, it has a peak horsepower and torque that are typical of similar
  engines of the same displacement. Being natually aspirated and utilizing port injection it is meant to serve
  as a sort of workhorse, reliable and economical. It has horizontally apposed pistons which helps lower the center
  of
  gravity when placed in the engine bay. The name of this style of engine is the boxer.</p>

    <b>Upgrades for Performance and Reliability</b>
    <p>Typcially natually aspirated <u>economy</u> engines get little support in the aftermarket, hower there are
      small number of modificaitons that can help make a little more power and increase reliability.Here are some of my
      engine modifications.</p>
