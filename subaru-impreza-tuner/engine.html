<h1>Subaru FB20B Engine - BOXER</h1>
<img class="letsbox" src="images/letsbox.jpeg" />

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The FB20B was designed as an economy engine, it has a peak horsepower and torque that are typical of similar
  engines of the same displacement. Being natually aspirated and utilizing port injection it is meant to serve
  as a sort of workhorse, reliable and economical. It has horizontally apposed pistons which helps lower the center
  of gravity when placed in the engine bay. The name of this style of engine is the boxer.</p>

<p>The FB20 is a little engine, its overall power is quite moderate. Being natrually apsirated, it would be difficult to
  add any significant numbers without a full-on rebuild and custom ECU tune.</p>
<p>Fret not, the small engine in stock form
  can still produce enough power to make for a fun driving car. Typically most people feel comfortable using the
  lower rev ranges for everyday driving. However for spirited driving, the Naturally Apsirated engine enjoys high revs
  in order to produce peak power. 4.2k-6.2k is the elastic range of the engine.</p>
<p> Aside, the ECU (engine control unit) has a
  throttle map that is rather conservative from the factory. This is meant to increase fuel efficiency. However, the ECU
  has the ability to "learn" the drivers preference and can adjust up to ~25%. What this means is, if you want to drive
  spiritedly, then do so. The ECU will adjust timing (AVCS) to increase the power. Over a number of miles, it will
  adjust accordingly. By and large, if you push the engine to its upper thresholds, it can produce more useable power.</p>

<b>Upgrades for Performance and Reliability</b>
<p>Typcially natually aspirated <u>economy</u> engines get little support in the aftermarket, however there are
  small number of modificaitons that can help make a little more power and increase reliability. Here are some of my
  engine modifications.</p>
