  <h1>Subaru Impreza Tuner - Engine - FB20B BOXER</h1>
  <img class="letsbox" src="images/letsbox.jpeg" />

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>The FB20B was designed as an economy engine, it has a peak horsepower and torque that are typical of similar
    engines of the same displacement. Being naturally aspirated and utilizing port injection it is meant to serve
    as a sort of workhorse, reliable and economical. It has horizontally apposed pistons which helps lower the center
    of gravity when placed in the engine bay. The name of this style of engine is the boxer.</p>

  <h3>Engine Specifications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Naturally Aspirated - port injection</li>
    <li>145 ft/lbs (197 N-m) @4200rpm</li>
    <li>148hp (110 kw) @6200rpm</li>
    <li>10.5:1 compression ratio</li>
    <li>2.0L Flat-4 cylinder</li>
    <li>DOHC w/ <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_valve_control_system">DAVCS</a></li>
    <li>0w-20w oil</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The FB20 is a little engine, its overall power is quite moderate. Being naturally aspirated, it would be difficult
    to
    add any significant numbers without a full-on rebuild and custom ECU tune.</p>
  <p>Fret not, the small engine in stock form
    can still produce enough power to make for a fun drive. Typically most people feel comfortable using the
    lower rev ranges for everyday driving. However for spirited driving, the Naturally Aspirated engine enjoys high revs
    in order to produce peak power. 4.2k-6.2k is the elastic range of the engine.</p>
  <p> Aside, the ECU (engine control unit) has a
    throttle map that is rather conservative from the factory. This is meant to increase fuel efficiency. However, the
    ECU
    has the ability to "learn" the drivers preference and can adjust up to ~25%. What this means is, if you want to
    drive
    spiritedly, then do so. The ECU will adjust timing (DAVCS) to increase the power. Over a number of miles, it will
    adjust accordingly. By and large, if you push the engine to its upper thresholds, it can produce more useable power
    and better performance.</p>

  <h3>Upgrades for Performance and Reliability</h3>
  <p>Typically naturally aspirated <u>economy</u> engines get little support in the aftermarket. There are options for
    building a more performant engine, but it is outside of the realm of what is feasible for an economy tuner. There
    are
    however some modifications that can help make a little more power and increase reliability. Here are some of my
    engine modifications.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>🔴 Apexi air filter - increase MAF g/s</li>
    <li>🟡 Takeda Intake piping - smoother 68mm inner diam. piping.</li>
    <li>🟢 Crawford - Billet Power Blocks - intake runner extensions for more streetable/usable torque. </li>
    <li>🟣 DIY Breather Catch Can - cleaner throttle body and intake tracks.</li>
    <li>🟠 Crawford AOS - PCV reliability</li>
    <li>Penzoil 5w-30w oil - heavier wt for heat protection</li>
    <li>Throttle Happy rev6 E-tune - Stage 1 OTS AUS 🇦🇺</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The FB20 is quite capable of producing more power to the wheels with some modifications. While it is no
    power-house,
    it has a scrappy nature which makes it undeniably enjoyable to drive.</p>
  <p>Below is a aggregated CVT dynograph compiled with real data. You'll see that WTQ rating are approaching engine TQ
    ratings, mainly due to driveline modifications covered in a later chapter.</p>
