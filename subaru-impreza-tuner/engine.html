  <h2>FB20B BOXER Engine Reliability and Performance</h2>
  <img class="letsbox" src="images/letsbox.jpeg" />

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>The FB20B was designed as an economy engine, it has a peak horsepower and torque that are typical of similar
    engines of the same displacement. Being naturally aspirated and utilizing port injection it is meant to serve
    as a sort of workhorse, reliable and economical. It has horizontally apposed pistons which helps lower the center
    of gravity when placed in the engine bay. The name of this style of engine is the "boxer".</p>

  <p>The FB20 is a little engine, its overall power is quite moderate. Being naturally aspirated, it would be difficult
    to add any significant numbers without a full-on rebuild and custom ECU tune.</p>
  <p>Fret not, the small engine in stock form
    can still produce enough power to make for a fun drive. Typically most people feel comfortable using the
    lower rev ranges for everyday driving. However for spirited driving, the Naturally Aspirated engine enjoys high revs
    in order to produce peak power. 4.2k-6.2k is the elastic range of the engine.</p>
  <p> Aside, the ECU (engine control unit) has a throttle map that is rather conservative from the factory. This is
    meant to increase fuel efficiency. However, the ECU has the ability to "learn" the drivers preference and can adjust
    up to ~25%. What this means is, if you want to drive spiritedly, then do so. The ECU will adjust timing (DAVCS) to
    increase the power. Over a number of miles, it will adjust accordingly. By and large, if you push the engine to its
    upper thresholds, it can produce more useable power and better performance.</p>

  <h3>Upgrades for Performance and Reliability</h3>
  <p>Typically naturally aspirated <u>economy</u> engines get little support in the aftermarket. There are options for
    building a more performant engine, but it is outside of the realm of what is feasible for an economy tuner. There
    are
    however some modifications that can help make a little more power and increase reliability. Here are some of my
    engine modifications.</p>

  <h3>Intake</h3>
  <p>Changing out the intake for a aftermarket one is often one of the first things people do. This can have a
    positive effect if the correct intake is chosen. The idea is to get more air into the engine by swapping out the
    stock air filter to a higher flowing one. For the most part simply adding a high flow panel filter provides good
    noticeable gains, between 2-5hp, also giving slightly quicker throttle response. </p>
  <p>Other people will choose a "cold air intake". Mainly for looks. Choose an intake that has a sealed air box. Avoid
    after market intakes that have exposed cone filters. These are mainly aesthetic intakes that actually suck in hot
    engine bay air. While these exposed cone filter intakes may have higher flow, the hot air pulled in (when the engine
    is hot) will significantly reduce power due to heat. </p>
  <p>When choosing an intake, it must keep hot engine bay heat away from the filter as well,
    have a higher flow than the stock panel paper filter. </p>

  <p>
    My hybrid setup uses the stock sealed airbox, a high flow panel filter, and a high flow pipe. On the stock setup I
    am able to pull ~108 g/s MAF. With the upgraded intake I can average 117+ g/s MAF. The generally accepted equation is 1gs = 1.25bhp
  </p>
  <p>The higher your Mass Airflow Rate, (MAF) the more potential horsepower the engine can make. </p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The FB20 is quite capable of producing more power to the wheels with some modifications. While it is no
    power-house,
    it has a scrappy nature which makes it undeniably enjoyable to drive.</p>
  <p>Below is an aggregated CVT dynograph compiled with real data. You'll see that WTQ rating are approaching engine TQ
    ratings, mainly due to driveline modifications covered in a later chapter.</p>
