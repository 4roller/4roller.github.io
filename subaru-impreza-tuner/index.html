  <h3 class='italic'>What is it?</h3>

  <div class='subaru'>It's a Subaru!</div>
  More specifcally it's a USDM 2016
  Subaru Impreza Sport Hatchback 2.0i CVT in Premium trim. These are the last Imprezas to be built in Gunma, Japan.
  I took delivery in Los Angeles, California.

  <h3>Lineage</h3>
  The <i class="set">GP7</i> hatchback chassis comes from a long line of Subaru wagons starting namely of the iconic
  first generation GF Outback Sport Wagon. The GG was the second generation 5 door wagon. Its direct predecessor,
  the 3rd generation Impreza GH(narrow) / GR (wide) hatchback shares a similar unibody design and
  has competed in rally and motorsports . You might say that the 4th generation GP(7) chassis also shares this
  motorsports pedigree.
  The same GP chassis is used in both the Impreza hatchback and the XV Crosstrek. The GT chassis code is the 5th
  generation 5-door wagon/hatchback. For all intents and purposes, the tuning and modificaitons contained in these
  pages are on the GP chassis but may also relate to other subaru models past and present.

    <h2>Poor Man Sport Mode</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Windows Down</li>
      <li>AC off</li>
      <li>VDC off</li>
      <li>Send it!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may have heard that turning off the cars Air Conditioning is like enabling turbo. More like, A/C saps
      power, mainly if the AC compressor is running it robs the engine of a little power in order to keep your
      hot-ass cool üî•üê¥ üÜí. If you're driving spiriteldy, A/C is a power sapping luxury. At full engine load,
      AC is automatically disabled. However turning off any "extra"
      systems like A/C, lighting, audio, and traction control systems can net more available resources for your
      car.</p>
    <p>Likewise VDC or Vehicle Dynamics Control is a traction control system. It works by monitoring wheel speed
      sensors for slippage reducing engine power and appling brakes to slipping wheels, to redirect power to
      wheels that grip. A very useful safety feature.</p>
    <h5>Why would I want to disable VDC?</h5>
    <p>Because why else would there be a button?</p>
    <p>The driver of the Subaru can regain some engine and braking control. Note, With VDC off it is never fully
      disabled, but the system will no longer fully limit the engine output, and sensitivily at which the ABS
      kicks in will be muted. This is perfect if there is traction loss, say in slipperly snow or gravel, or
      pavement drift , when you need to engine power to push you through. </p>
    <p>It must be noted that by disabling the nanny, you are physically pressing a button to release a little
      genie. Where you, the driver, have been released from the shackles of mediocrity. What you do with this
      freedom is up to you. üßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
    <p>- insert picture of your car drifting -</p>
    <p>Another usful benefit from disabling VDC, is an extra 200 revolutions regained at the upper
      end of the engines rpm range. By default, with VDC enabled, the engine can rev to 6000rpms. Healthy, yet the
      in order to achieve the manufacturers peak horse power specifications, VDC must be disabled to allow the
      engine to rev up to 6200rpm. This is how you unlock that final top end horsepower. If I was to be honest,
      maybe the final 2-5hp. Perfect for the poor man trying to milk every last fractional pony. </p>
    <p>By opening your windows, turning off some creature comforts (A/C), and muting the nanny (VDC), you can
      truely realise the poor mans sport mode üòé</p>
    <p>Caveats: Disabling VDC is likely to enable fun boi antics and a high revving engine . Your transmission CVT
      (fluid, solenoids) or clutch, engine (oil, coolant, seals), exhaust (catalytic converter) may overheat after
      prolonged use. You may break something or at very least get some check engine lights. With great power (üòÇ)
      comes great responsibility.</p>
