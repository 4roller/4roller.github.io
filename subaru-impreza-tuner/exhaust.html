    <h1>Subaru Impreza Tuner</h1>
    <h2>Exhaust</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The 2012-2016 Impreza and 2013-2017 Crosstrek have for the most part, 2 inches (50mm) piping throughout
        the exhaust system.</p>

    <h3>Exhaust Specifications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Exhaust Manifold - Primaries are 41.5mm I.D. The output after the catalytic converter, is 50mm or 2 inches.
        </li>
        <li>Front Pipe - 2 inch inlet into secondary catalytic converter, outlet 2.25 inch</li>
        <li>Mid Pipe - 2.25 inch inlet into resonator, outlet 2 inch</li>
        <li>Tail Pipe - 2 inch inlet into chambered muffler, outlet 2 inch</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exhaust sizing</h3>
    <p>Subaru Engineers spent some time on this generations exhaust. A complaint about the previous generations' EJ
        engines
        were they were gas-hungry and produced poor torque in the lower RPM ranges. The introduction
        of the FB engines changed those downfalls improving on fuel economy with a more efficient design and more
        street-able low end torque. I am a firm believer that the design and size of exhaust chosen has a significant
        effect on helping address that much desired low end torque needed for daily driving.</p>

    <p>From the details above, you will note that the OEM exhaust manifolds exit with a 2 inches outlet after the main
        catalytic converter. Given the application the car was designed for, compact/economy segment. The size of the
        piping chosen, allows the exhaust gas to maintain a high velocity. This is particularly good for exhaust
        scavenging, increasing the overall efficiency of the system. The pipe sizing is free flowing enough for the
        moderately displaced 2L engine in higher RPMs.</p>
    <p> There is also the 2.25 piping after the secondary catalytic
        converter and before the resonator. I believe this segment of the exhaust was purposely added to slow down the
        exhaust velocity just before the resonator to help reduce some of the sound
        coming from the engine.</p>
    <p>The remaining 2" piping all the way to the muffler would then strike a balance of weight and cost without
        effecting much of the noise or performance of the engine.
    </p>


    <h3>Exhaust Tuning</h3>
    <p>It has been quoted that a 2 or 2.5 litre naturally aspirated engine, needs no more than a 2.5" exhaust
        diameter piping. Where 3" large diameter piping will free up the exhaust completely allowing for maximum power
        in high RPMs, it will have an ill effect on torque and drivability.</p>
    <p>The goal in Naturally aspirated exhaust tuning is to strike a balance between the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sound/noise level</li>
        <li>Low end torque</li>
        <li>High end power</li>
        <li>Appearance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Torque and Power</h3>
    <p>For a street car, low end torque is desireable for city driving. To tune for low end torque, the amount of "back
        pressure" needs to be considered. Too little (as with the case of oversized piping), then low end torque is
        lost. Too much back pressure (as with overly small pipes), will restrict the engines ability to evacuate exhaust
        causing a reduction in maximum power typically found in high RPMs.</p>
    </p>

    <h3>Sound and Appearance</h3>
    <p>Tuning for sound and appearance a secondary to the performance tuner. In any case both the sound and the
        appearance should be tuned for the driver.</p>

    <h3>Exhaust Parts</h3>
    <h4>Header</h4>

    </figure>
    <p>The OEM exhaust manifold is designed with a few considerations. It is casted steel 4-1 equal-length log-type
        design fitted with head shields. The casted steel cuts down on cost, holds heat well, and due to its weight also
        reduces exhaust noise. It weighs ~20lbs. Its primary pipe size is 35mm I.D. and the output after the built-in
        catalytic converter is 50mm.</p>

    <p>They say with naturally-aspirated engines, an exhaust header is typically the biggest power gain one can hope for
        from any single bolt-on modification. The reasoning behind this is that aftermarket header(s) should
        theoretically allow for better exhaust flow. </p>

    <p>The Inferno Fabrications header (below) is a 4-2-1 equal-length design. Its weight is ~12.5lbs. Its primary pipe
        size of 41.5mm I.D. and the output after the catalytic converter is measured at 52.5mm I.D.</p>

    <h5>Observations</h5>
    <p>The volume of exhaust gas that of the aftermarket header is greater than that
        of the OEM manifold. While this is good for high-output scenarios where the engine is running in high RPMs, the
        extra volume can lower the initial exhaust velocity. This can effect the exhaust scavenging efficiency and also
        reduce
        torque at lower RPMs. Ultimately this will effect street-drivability.</p>
    <p>A couple of techniques can be used to combat these loses.
    <ul>
        <li>Insulate the header to retain exhaust gas temperatures. This helps retain exhaust gas velocity, which
            ultimately helps the exhaust gas scavenging. Scavenging evacuates burn gases from the cylinder which allows
            for more fuel/fresh air to enter on the next combustion cycle.</li>
        <li>Tune the engine via the ECU to compensate for accelerator tip-in.</li>
    </ul>
    The pros of having these aftermarket header(s) is that in high RPM and high load situations, exhaust gas can flow
    easily producing more peak power.
    </p>

    <p>While some people will opt for an un-equal length header purely for sound, this is not recommend for individuals
        seeking to get the most out of the naturally aspirated engine. For engine longevity, and power, look for
        an equal length design. Consider the differences between 4-2-1 and 4-1 designs. Also consider cat-less or with a catalytic converter.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>While I am in the early stages of tuning the exhaust on my Impreza, I am able to say with certainty that each
        exhaust (or intake) modification done, will affect how the engine breathes. In turn the harmonics of the car
        will change. You may pick up some strange vibrations or droning in certain RPM ranges, sound and vibrations will
        be different. You may increase or decrease torque and power. Consider what the goals of your modifications are,
        and
        if you can live with differences in power deliver and NVH in search of the perfect exhaust setup. All these
        should be considered as they will ultimately effect drivability.</p>
