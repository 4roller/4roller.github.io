<p>The Subaru Impreza Sport comes with 5.9" ground clearance. It uses a front MacPherson strut based design, and a
    multi-link rear suspension.</p>
<p> The GP chassis (Impreza and XV Crosstrek) share a similar suspension design, the XV using lifted components.</p>
<p>The subframes and unibody shares attach points similar to Subaru's GH hatchback chassis found on 2008-2010 WRX and 3rd Generation Imprezas. Therefore for aftermarket support, like coilovers you can use 2008+ WRX GH designed components.</p>
<p>
    Stock front sway bars are 22mm, 24mm (crosstrek) and on the rear a 16mm. Base model Imprezas do not include a rear sway
    bar.</p>

<p>It is often stated that suspension can transform a car, and this statement couldn't be more true with the
    Impreza. Keeping the stock springs and struts, the first handling modificaiton on anyones list should be a thicker
    rear sway bar. The 19/20mm STI rear sway bar is an inexpensive modificaiton that can help reduce body roll and
    increase cornering ability.</p>

<p>The next thing would either be lowering springs or coilovers. I opted for Fortune Auto
    500 coil-overs. 8k/8k switft springs and radial bearings. These come with adjustable front camber aluminum top
    plates.
    Adding coilovers with ride-height adjustabiliy has been very fun with marked improvment in agilty though corners.
</p>
<p>At this point depending on your build, both front and rear sway bar thickness can be increased as a tuning
    device. I've found that a 2mm difference between front and rear is a good balance. Either 22mm/20mm or what I've
    settle on is 24mm front (from the crosstrek) and a 22mm rear from Whiteline is about perfect neutral balance.</p>

<p>Strut tower bars are also available. These typically tie both strut tops together to reduce chassis flex under
    hard cornering. I opted for the STI flexible front strut tower bar offering which promises ride comfort while
    still maintaining chassis stiffness. In my experenice only under extreme cornering does the front sturt bar have
    any effect. I think a solid bar would be more noticable. Rear bars are also used, however their installation often
    reduces trunk utilization because they block a section of the flat floor.
</p>
<p>Suspension is something that has many components to it. By adding a new aftermarket part, you can tune your cars
    handling. Other possible suspension additions include:
<ul>
    <li>Adj. rear lower control arms (to correct camber)</li>
    <li>Adj. rear toe links</li>
    <li>Adj. sway bar end-links</li>
    <li>Trailing links</li>
    <li>Various polyurethane bushings, roll-center adjustments</li>

</ul>
