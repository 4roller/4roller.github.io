<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Subaru Impreza Sport comes with 5.9" ground clearance. It uses a front MacPherson strut based design, and a
    multi-link rear suspension.</p>
<p> The GP chassis (Impreza and XV Crosstrek) share a similar suspension design, the XV using lifted components.</p>
<p>The subframes and unibody shares attach points similar to Subaru's GH hatchback chassis found on 2008-2010 WRX and
    3rd Generation Imprezas. Therefore for aftermarket support, like coilovers you can use 2008+ WRX GH designed
    components.</p>
<p>
    Stock front sway bars are 22mm, (24mm on the crosstrek) and on the rear a 16mm. Base model Imprezas do not include a
    rear swaybar.</p>

<p>It is often stated that suspension can transform a car. This statement couldn't be more true with the
    Impreza. </p>



<h3>Sway bars, Anti-roll bars, stabalizer bars</h3>

<p>Keeping the stock springs and struts, the first handling modificaiton on anyones list should be a thicker
    rear sway bar. The 19/20mm STI rear sway bar is an inexpensive modificaiton that can help reduce body roll and
    increase cornering ability.</p>

<h3>Get Low-er</h3>
<p>Lowering the car (withing reason) can increase cornering ability by lowering the center of gravity. This can be
    achienved by the use of lower springs (a good choice for salty winter regions) or adjustable coilover suspension.
    I opted for Fortune Auto 500 coil-overs (For the GH chassis). They have 8k/8k switft springs and radial bearings.
    These come with adjustable front camber aluminum top plates which increase driver feedback, at the expense of more
    NVH (noise harshness and vibration). Adding coilovers with ride-height adjustabiliy has been very fun with marked
    improvment in agilty though corners.
</p>
<p>At this point depending on your build, as a tuning device both front and rear sway bar thickness can be increased.
    Thicker REAR sway bars help tune out understeer (promote oversteer), while a thicker front sway bar increase
    understeer (reduces oversteer). I've found that a 2mm difference between front and rear is a good balance. I've
    settle on is 24mm front (from the crosstrek) and a 22mm rear for a neutral balance.</p>

<h3>Lose the slop</h3>
<p>On my build, the rear suspension has been upgrade to take advantage of polyurethane bushing and spherical ball joints
    to maximize driveline transmission efficiency and remove slop. The rear multi-link suspension comes alive when
    stiffer bushing are used. Power transfer is more direct, torque to the rear wheels increases as a result.
    Most noticable changes were the trailing arms. Beefier toe links reduce geometry deflection in heavy corners. The
    adjustable lower control arms correct any added camber when lowering the car.</p>

<p>My alignment is:
<ul>
    <li>Front 1.8 degree camber - 0 degree toe - corrected for driver weight </li>
    <li>Rear 1.6 degree camber - 0.1 degree toe</li>
</ul>
I find this to be a very good compromise for tire wear and handling on a street car.
</p>



<h3>Bracing</h3>
<p>I am pretty new the subject of bracing, but from the standpoint of the unibody construction, twisting
    loads can be greatly reduced by adding chassi bracing. Bracing keeps the chassis "square" and allows the suspension
    to work better. The chassis will deflect less allowing more predictable handling.</p>

Strut Tower bars
<p>Strut bars (for short) work in conjuction with the suspension. These typically tie both strut tops together to reduce
    chassis flex under hard cornering. I opted for the STI flexible front strut tower bar offering which promises ride
    comfort while still maintaining chassis stiffness. In my experenice only under extreme cornering does the front
    sturt bar have any effect as the firewall typically provides frontal rigidity. I think a solid bar would be more
    noticable. Rear bars are also used, however their installation often reduces trunk utilization because they block a
    section of the flat floor.

<p>
    Most recently I found a 3-point rear strut tower bar that does not take up any of the existing trunk space. It came
    to me from Russia and hides neatly under everything. The rear strut bar is a very good upgrade, even more so if you
    have a hatchback (the rear of the unibody is quote hollow and allows for much flex). The bonus feature is that it
    has 3 tie points rather than 2. This adds an extra tie point to
    maintain chassis rigidity. </p>

Traciton bars
<p>Suspension support brackets (as Subaru calls it) help reinforce the front lower control arm area. The original piece
    are stamped steel. The TB Performance part makes use of strong tubular steel.</p>

<p>Suspension is something that has many components to it. By adding a new aftermarket part, you can tune your cars
    handling. There are many more options for suspension and bracing. The point is that each upgrade is an incremental
    increase in handling performance. The tuner can focus much attention in this area. This will set your car apart from
    many vehicles and modders who focus primarily on power mods..</p>
