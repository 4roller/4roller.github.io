    <h2>Suspension and Handling</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Subaru Impreza Sport comes with 5.9" ground clearance. It uses a front MacPherson strut based design, and a
        multi-link rear suspension.</p>
    <p> The GP chassis (Impreza and XV Crosstrek) share a similar suspension design, the XV using lifted components.</p>
    <p>The subframes and unibody shares attach (hard) points similar with Subaru's GH narrow body hatchback chassis
        found on 2008-2010 WRX and 3rd Generation Imprezas. Therefore aftermarket support, like coil-overs, can be used
        from 2008+ WRX GH designed components.</p>
    <p>
        Stock front sway bars are 22mm, (24mm on the crosstrek) and on the rear a 16mm. Base model Imprezas do not
        include a rear sway bar.</p>

    <p>It is often stated that suspension can transform a car. This statement couldn't be more true with the
        Impreza. While the suspension in stock form is soft and compliant, it can be tuned to become very predictable in
        handling and agility and produce a more direct power transfer to the wheels. </p>



    <h3>Sway bars, Anti-roll bars, stabilizer bars</h3>
    <figure>

    </figure>


    <p>Keeping the stock springs and struts, the first handling modification on any ones list should be a thicker
        rear sway bar. Most of the cars come with a 16mm rear sway bar which produces a significant roll in corners as
        well
        as feelings of lazy and under steer. The 19/20mm STI rear sway bar is an inexpensive modification that can help
        reduce body roll and increase cornering ability even with stock suspension.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>Thicker REAR sway bars help tune out understeer (promote oversteer), while a thicker front sway bar increase
        understeer (reduces oversteer). I've found that a 2mm difference between front and rear is a good balance. I've
        settled on is 24mm front (from the crosstrek) and a 22mm rear for a neutral balance.</p>

    <h3>Get Low-er</h3>
    <p>Lowering the car (withing reason) can increase cornering ability by lowering the center of gravity. This can be
        achieved by the use of lowering springs (a good low-maintenance choice for salty winter regions) or adjustable
        coil-over suspension. Coupled with the low CoG boxer engine, lowering the car will have a compound effect.</p>

        <img class="hero" src="images/FA500-and-oem-strut.jpg" />
        <figcaption>OEM and Aftermarket struts</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        I opted for Fortune Auto 500 coil-overs (For the GH chassis). They have 8k/8k Swift springs and radial bearings.
        These come with adjustable front camber aluminum top plates which increase driver feedback, at the expense of
        more
        NVH (noise harshness and vibration). Adding coil-overs with ride-height adjustability has been very fun with
        marked
        improvement in agility though corners.
    </p>
    <p>After lowering you car, consider adjustable rear lower control arms to bring rear camber back into spec. An
        alignment is most certainly needed. The tuner can then revisit the front and sway bars to
        achieve the desired steering/roll balance.</p>


    <h3>Lose the slop</h3>
    <p>On my build, the rear suspension has been upgraded to take advantage of polyurethane bushings and spherical ball
        joints. This helps to maximize driveline transmission efficiency and remove unwanted slop. The rear multi-link
        suspension comes alive when stiffer bushing are used. Power transfer is more direct, torque to the rear wheels
        increases as a result.</p>

    <p>
        Most noticeable changes were the trailing arms. Beefier toe links reduce geometry deflection in heavy corners.
        The
        adjustable lower control arms correct any added camber when lowering the car.</p>

    <p>My alignment is:
    <ul>
        <li>Front 1.8 degree camber - 0 degree toe - corrected for driver weight </li>
        <li>Rear 1.6 degree camber - 0.1 degree toe</li>
    </ul>
    I find this to be a very good compromise for tire wear and handling on a street car.

    <h3>Bracing</h3>
    <p>I am pretty new the subject of bracing, but from the standpoint of the unibody construction, twisting
        loads can be greatly reduced by adding chassis bracing. Bracing keeps the chassis "square" and allows the
        suspension
        to work better. The chassis will deflect less allowing for more predictable handling at or near the limit.</p>

    <h4>Strut Tower bars</h4>
    <p>Strut bars (for short) work in conjunction with the suspension. These typically tie both strut tops together to
        reduce chassis flex under hard cornering. </p>
    <p>I opted for the STI flexible front strut tower bar offering which promises ride
        comfort while still maintaining chassis stiffness. In my experience only under extreme cornering does the front
        strut bar have any effect as the firewall typically provides frontal rigidity. I think a solid bar would be more
        noticeable.</p>
    <p> Rear bars are also used, however their installation often reduces trunk utilization because they block a
        section of the flat floor.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
        Most recently I found a 3-point rear strut tower bar that does not take up any of the existing trunk space. It
        came to me from Russia and hides neatly under everything. The rear strut bar is a very good upgrade, even more
        so if you have a hatchback (the rear of the unibody is quite hollow and allows for much flex). The bonus feature
        is that it has 3 tie points rather than 2. This adds an extra tie point to maintain chassis rigidity. The
        3-point sturt brace in the rear really stiffens up the unibody to the point that the rear sway bar starts
        working better. Recommended.</p>

    <h4>Traction bars</h4>
    <p>Suspension support brackets (as Subaru calls it) help reinforce the front lower control arm area. The original
        piece are stamped steel. The TB Performance part makes use of strong tubular steel.</p>

    <h3>Additional tuning parts for handling</h3>
    <p>
        In addition to the parts mentioned above, there are a number of handling tuning parts available from Subaru
        (STI) and other manufacturers. Here are a few.
    </p>

    <h4>STI Draw Stiffener </h4>
    <figure>
        <img class="not-full" src="images/STI-front-draw-stiffener.jpg" />
        <figcaption>STI front draw stiffener</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The draw stiffener at its core is a spring loaded tie rod, drawing together two parts of the under chassis,
        mainly the transmission and one of the control front arms. It can extend from 0-14mm. It is installed with 2mm
        of preload tension.</p>
    <p>It is recommended that this part be used in conjunction with the STI Flexible strut tower bar.
        Without these two parts, you can't really quantify the amount of chassis flex for this road going passenger
        economy car. The car in stock form is just sort of soft without really noticing it. However after install there
        is a noticeable harmonic spring-like change of the chassis when driving over irregular road. Cornering
        spiritedly provides a sort of 'energized" feedback. </p>

    <h4>Steering Lock down</h4>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/steering-lockdown.jpeg" />
        <figcaption>Steering damper lock-down</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Better steering feedback can be had with a simple inexpensive part known as the steering damper lock-down.
        The OEM steering knuckle contains a rubber bushing which allows for reduced vibration through the steering
        wheel. However, because it is made from rubber, it leaves some play in the steering which can be felt as
        vagueness when cornering. The steering damper lock-down is a 2 piece clamp which reduces the steering slop. You
        can find them made by Perrin, or Torque Solutions. It is a simple, easy-to-install, effective way to get better
        steering feedback.</p>

    <h4>Subframe bushing inserts</h4>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/subframe-bushing.jpg" />
        <figcaption>Rear Subframe bushing</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>With much of the chassis' weight supported by the rear subframe. it is understandable as a passenger car the ride
        should be compliant. The chassis rides on a set of 4 rear subframe bushings that flex under acceleration,
        braking and cornering. Over time, these OEM rubber subframe bushings can deteriorate. The rubber bushings also
        contain large gaps to can cause the chassis to shift a fair amount (a few centimeters) in any direction.</p>
    <p>This is quite a disadvantage to the performance oriented driver and causes some unpredictability. In order to
        correct this, subframe bushing inserts can be used to tighten up the connection between chassis and subframe.
        Not only does this help reduce chassis on subframe movements, but also guarantees the rear drivetrain to engage
        much
        more directly. The effect is more torque delivered to the rear wheels. Recommended. </p>

    <h4>Rear Subframe Brace</h4>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/Impreza-rear-end.jpg" />
        <figcaption>Rear Subframe brace (in Gold)</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In conjunction with the rear subframe bushing inserts is the rear subframe brace, pictured here in gold running
        between the two rear subframe bolts. The sole effect of this brace is to reduce lateral (side-to-side) motion of
        the chassis on the subframe. This is achieved by "tying" the two rear subframe bolts together. The reduction of
        the rear end snapping back after a hard corner is significantly reduced with this brace and thus highly
        recommended for slalom, autocross, canyon driving, or general spirted driving which involves accurate cornering.
    </p>


    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Suspension and handling is something that has many components to it. By adding a new aftermarket part, you can
        tune your cars handling. There are many more options for suspension, bracing and handling. The point is that
        each upgrade is an incremental increase in handling performance. The tuner can focus much attention in this
        area. This will set your car apart from many vehicles and modifications which focus primarily on power.</p>
    <p> Cornering and agility are already a strength of this platform, adding better suspension, bracing and handling
        components can elevate ones driving experience. </p>
