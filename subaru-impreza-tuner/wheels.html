    <h2> The Wheels</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Impreza Sport alloy 17x7 wheels 5x100 +48 offset 24.x lbs
        </li>

        <li>OEM-equipped tire: 205/50/R17 - Yokohama AVID S34D</li>
        <li>
            These can also be found on a 2004 outback XT /LL Bean which ran 225/55R17
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The wheel mod</h3>

    <p>Rotating mass. We're trying to reduce it. So any wheel (rim) that is lighter (and hopefully stronger) than the
        OEM
        rims will be a good choice for upgrades.</p>
    <p>I got a sweet deal on a mint set of JDM STI wheels which are 6-7lbs lighter. They are "flow formed" using Enkei's
        MAT
        process. OEM+, light, strong and a good price? K'mon! on they went.</p>

    <h3>Tires</h3>

    <p>You know the drill, good tires means grip. A decently priced and Summer tire is worlds apart from the stock OE
        Spec
        Yokahomas. Since Imprezas is an AWD car, grip is the game. Treat yo'self.</p>

    <h3>Wheel Spacers</h3>
    <p>
        A common modification for aesthetics is adding wheel spacers to get a more "flush" look. However there are some
        performance benefits for adding wheel spacers, mainly widening track width. I've added 20mm spacers all
        around which increases the track width of the Impreza to 61"/61.5" which is wider than a stock WRX. Adding track
        width increases lateral grip when cornering giving a more predictable slip when cornering at the limit. Adding
        wheel spacers softens the suspension by effectively lengthening the suspension arm "lever".</p>
    <p>
        Adding wheel spacers does not come without some detractors. There are some things that the tuner must consider.
        Adding
        spacers increases rotating mass, which reduces acceleration, and braking. Since the spacers push wheels out
        further, it also acts as a longer lever which in certain situations can amplify bushing flex in control
        arms. There is also the effect of slower initial turn in, however this corrects itself quickly on more steering
        input. There will be more "scrub". Finally there is also slightly more wheel bearing wear.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of spacers is similar to that of using smaller offset wheels, so both would have similar effects stated
        above. Consider the reasons for adding wheel spacers. More often than not, the OEM offset (+48 or +53 for most
        Subarus) is often the best compromise for handling. Another way to achieve a more "flush" look with the fender
        is to run wider wheels, but those also have their disadvantages mentioned below.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
    <p>While I am not here to dictate how you build your car and platform, I have noticed one place where many people
        fall
        victim to style-tuning vs performance-tuning. Often times I will see people slap on heavy and wide wheels purely
        to
        achieve a stanced look. Often times this results in poor acceleration and braking. While cornering load is
        technically better with wider wheels, a balance must be struck in order to attain all-round performance. A tire
        no
        wider than 235 has been quoted as the upper limit of this platforms tractive needs. Any wider will have
        significant
        scrub. Heavy and wide wheels may look good, but they will also hurt performance. Take note. </p>
    <p>As a tuning reference, the STI optional wheels for this car are 17x7, Taking it one step further in the OEM+
        direction, more performance oriented Subaru platforms BRZ/Forester utilize a 17x7.5 wheel. If we were to apply
        the
        +1 rule, 18x8.5 would be the ideal upper limit for wheel sizing. </p>
