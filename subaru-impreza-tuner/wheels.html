<p>Rotating mass. We're trying to reduce it. So any wheel (rim) that is lighter (and hopefully stronger) than the OEM
    rims will be a good choice for upgrades.</p>
<p>I got a sweet deal on a mint set of JDM STI wheels which are 6-7lbs lighter. They are "flow formed" using Enkei's MAT
    process. OEM+, light, strong and a good price? K'mon! on they went.</p>

    <p>You know the drill, good tires means grip. A decently priced and Summer tire is worlds apart from the stock OE Spec Yokahomas. Treat yo'self. </p>
