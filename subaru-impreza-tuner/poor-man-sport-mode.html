  </ul>
  <p>You may have heard that turning off the cars Air Conditioning is like enabling turbo. More like, A/C saps
    power, mainly if the AC compressor is running it robs the engine of a little power in order to keep your
    hot-ass cool 🔥🐴 🆒. If you're driving spiritedly, A/C is a power sapping luxury. At full engine load,
    AC is automatically disabled. However turning off any "extra"
    systems like A/C, lighting, audio, and traction control systems can net more available resources for your
    car.</p>
  <p>Likewise VDC or Vehicle Dynamics Control is a traction control system. It works by monitoring wheel speed
    sensors for slippage reducing engine power and applying brakes to slipping wheels, to redirect power to
    wheels that grip. A very useful safety feature.</p>



  <h5>Why would I want to disable VDC?</h5>
  <p>Because why else would there be a button?</p>
  <p>The driver of the Subaru can regain some engine and braking control. Note, With VDC off it is never fully
    disabled, but the system will no longer fully limit the engine output, and sensitivity at which the ABS
    kicks in will be muted. This is perfect if there is traction loss, say in slippery snow or gravel, or
    pavement drift , when you need to engine power to push you through. </p>
  <p>It must be noted that by disabling the nanny, you are physically pressing a button to release a little
    genie. Where you, the driver, have been released from the shackles of mediocrity. What you do with this
    freedom is up to you. 🧞‍♀️</p>

  <p>Another useful benefit from disabling VDC, is an extra 200 revolutions regained at the upper
    end of the engines rpm range. By default, with VDC enabled, the engine can rev to 6000RPMs. Healthy, yet the
    in order to achieve the manufacturers peak horse power specifications, VDC must be disabled to allow the
    engine to rev up to 6200rpm. This is how you unlock that final top end horsepower. If I was to be honest,
    maybe the final 2-5hp. Perfect for the poor man trying to milk every last fractional pony. </p>
  <p>By opening your windows, turning off some creature comforts (A/C), and muting the nanny (VDC), you can
    truly realise the poor mans sport mode 😎</p>
  <p>Caveats: Disabling VDC is likely to enable fun boi antics and a high revving engine . Your transmission CVT
    (fluid, solenoids) or clutch, engine (oil, coolant, seals), exhaust (catalytic converter) may overheat after
    prolonged use. You may break something or at very least get some check engine lights. With great power (😂)
    comes great responsibility.</p>
