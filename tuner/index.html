    </figure>
    <p>The FB20B was designed as an economy engine, it has a peak horsepower and torque that are typical of similar
      engines of the same displacement. Being natually aspirated and utilizing port injection it is meant to serve
      as a sort of workhorse, reliable and economical. It is horizontally apposed which helps lower the center of
      gravity when placed in the engine bay.</p>

    <b>Upgrades for Performance and Reliability</b>
    <p>Typcially natually aspirated economy engines get little support in the aftermarket, hower there are
      small number of modificaitons that can help make a little more power and increase reliability.</p>

      <h3>The TR580 Transmission </h3>
      <figure class='cvt'>
        <img src="images/TR580-cvt.png" alt="TR580 CVT">
      </figure>
      <p>The TR580 is a Subaru "Lineartronic" CVT. The number 580 relates to its length in millimeters.
        The transmission uses a metal chain and pulley system to vary the drive ratios. This transmission is categorized
        as an automatic and so, coupled with a torque converter. There is the option to utilize a 6 speed manual shift
        mode via/ steering wheel paddle shifters.
      </p>
      <p>The CVT utilizes "Active Torque Split" which is an electronically controlled multi-plate transfer clutch that
        can dynamically distributes power between front and rear axles. Anywhere from 60% F / 40% R for crusing
        or 50% F / 50% R on-demand. This allows the tranmission efficiency and better gas mileage.</p>
      </ul>

      <b>Maintenance</b>
      <p>For the most part the tranmission is reliable. It is often stated that the transmission fluid should be
        checked/replaced
        every 30k miles. This can help keep the fluid coupling of the pulley system and valving in good working order.
      </p>
      <b>Reliability</b>
      <p>Heat is the number one enemy of this transmision. The oem CVT heater/cooler "can" is tied to the coolant
        system via an water/oil heat exchange. In some cases, during prolonged periods of high load, the cvt cooling
        system it is insufficient. The CVT fluid becomes too hot and trips a "limp mode" which limits engine RPMs to
        below 4000 and only allows the CVT to run in less taxing gear ratios. For this reason it is recommended that
        a CVT cooler be installed. An inline method (utilizes oem cooler) or the bypass method can be used depending on
        climate zone you live in.</p>
      <b>Performance </b>
      <p>Another way to extract the most fun out of the transmission is to utilize the 6 speed manual mode via paddle
        shifters. By using manual mode, it is possible to shift the transmission sequentially. Manual mode also
        allows the driver to rev up to ~6000rpms before the transmission automatically shifts into the next gear ratio.
        While using manual mode it is also possible to hold RPMs for engine braking. The CVT has an automatic safety
        check which does not let the engine over rev. This is typically denoted as a beep, when the driver has requestd
        a ratio shift (downshift), but the engine is already above 4000rpm. The CVT unlike the manual transmission
        utilizes a dynamic power deliver between the front and rear wheels.</p>
      </p>
      <img src="images/CVT-pull.jpg " />
      <p>Above is a rather strange looking dyno graph derived from real data. A gear ratio change using the
        variable ratio pullies, can produce an interesting torque surge to the AWD system.</p>

      <h3> Driveline upgrades aka "Power Delivery"</h3>
      <p>The Subaru is an All-Wheel-Drive vehicle. It is said that between 17-25% of total power can be lost
        between the engine - transmission - driveline and wheels, there is addtional tax of ~2% for automatic
        transmissions, like the CVT in this
        car. For reference FWD and RWD cars have drivetrain losses between 10-15% and 10-18% respectively.</p>
      <p>
        Unlike most tuner cars, the aftermarket engine-power options for the FB20 are limited. With that in mind we,
        the tuner can turn
        focus towards improving driveline efficiencies.</p>
      <p> There are a number of places where Subaru uses soft
        bushings to provide a comfortable ride. However by replacing these bushings with harder materials we can
        improve power transfer, thus reducing AWD drivetrain losses. As with all bushing upgrades, NVH will increase.

      <h3>Poor Man Sport Mode</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Windows Down</li>
        <li>AC off</li>
        <li>VDC off</li>
        <li>Send it!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may have heard that turning off the cars Air Conditioning is like enabling turbo. More like, A/C saps
        power, mainly if the AC compressor is running it robs the engine of a little power in order to keep your
        hot-ass cool 🔥🐴 🆒. If you're driving spiriteldy, A/C is a power sapping luxury. At full engine load,
        AC is automatically disabled. However turning off any "extra"
        systems like A/C, lighting, audio, and traction control systems can net more available resources for your
        car.</p>
      <p>Likewise VDC or Vehicle Dynamics Control is a traction control system. It works by monitoring wheel speed
        sensors for slippage reducing engine power and appling brakes to slipping wheels, to redirect power to
        wheels that grip. A very useful safety feature.</p>
      <h5>Why would I want to disable VDC?</h5>
      <p>Because why else would there be a button?</p>
      <p>The driver of the Subaru can regain some engine and braking control. Note, With VDC off it is never fully
        disabled, but the system will no longer fully limit the engine output, and sensitivily at which the ABS
        kicks in will be muted. This is perfect if there is traction loss, say in slipperly snow or gravel, or
        pavement drift , when you need to engine power to push you through. </p>
      <p>It must be noted that by disabling the nanny, you are physically pressing a button to release a little
        genie. Where you, the driver, have been released from the shackles of mediocrity. What you do with this
        freedom is up to you. 🧞‍♀️</p>
      <p>- insert picture of your car drifting -</p>
      <p>By far the most interesting benefit from disabling VDC, is an extra 200 revolutions regained at the upper
        end of the engines rpm range. By default, with VDC enabled, the engine can rev to 6000rpms. Healthy, yet the
        in order to achieve the manufacturers peak horse power specifications, VDC must be disabled to allow the
        engine to rev up to 6200rpm. This is how you unlock that final top end horsepower. If I was to be honest,
        maybe the final 2-5hp. Perfect for the poor man trying to milk every last fractional pony. </p>
      <p>By opening your windows, turning off some creature comforts (A/C), and muting the nanny (VDC), you can
        truely realise the poor mans sport mode 😎</p>
      <p>Caveats: Disabling VDC is likely to enable fun boi antics and a high revving engine . Your transmission CVT
        (fluid, solenoids) or clutch, engine (oil, coolant, seals), exhaust (catalytic converter) may overheat after
        prolonged use. You may break something or at very least get some check engine lights. With great power (😂)
        comes great responsibility 🕷️</p>

    <h3>📘 Origin Story</h3>
    <p>Assmebled in Japan, this pacticular Subaru came with a factory installed <span class="cherry">STI</span></STI>
      roof spoiler.
      Out of all the Imprezas being built for the final production run of the 4th generation Imprezas,
      only a handful would be choosen to have a factory installed STI tuning part. It's special in a way.
      I basically chose it because of that.</p>

    <aside>
      When I was a teenager, I worked a summer job assembiling delivery trucks 🚐.
      Each truck was based on a work order. Some work orders would have
      extra parts that set them apart from the dozens of regular builds. For some reason, because these
      trucks were spec'd higher, I would put more heart into building the truck.
      I believe my Impreza was one such vehicle. ♥️Spirt⚡️!</aside>

      <h3>Function over everything </h3>
      <p>In all honesty, I didn't know what kind of car I was buying, only that it fit my initial buying criteria.
        Hatchback with good trunk space (I actually wanted a wagon), and good on gas.
        For the better part of a year I drove it stock.

      <h3>Utility</h3>
      <p>
        Commuter, errands, family duties, the Subaru handles it all. There were gripes about 'weak engine'
        expressed here and there, but for the most part it was a workhorse for a single-child family. However after the
        second
        child, the car was reliquished of its family transportation roles. However, it still retains a groccery getter
        status 😂</p>


      <h3>Enter Tuner</h3>
      <p>After dropping off the kids and the wife into a more family suited vehicle, the shackles were removed.
        No longer does smooth, quiet and comfortable need to be adjectives that describe this car. Rice, I mean Race car
        would be the new charade.</p>

      <aside>Being a newb. The quest for perfomance has to start out being inexpensive, what is the best bang for the
        buck.
        The goal of the build is extract the soul of the car through mechencalical modification, a frankenstine for
        betterment of passager car
        performance.
